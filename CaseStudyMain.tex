\section{Scenario Description}

The Campus Café is a student-operated coffee shop located in the main university building. While business has grown significantly in recent semesters, the internal processes are still handled manually. The team uses printed order slips, handwritten inventory records, and personal spreadsheets to track daily operations. To professionalize the workflow and prepare for future growth, the café board has decided to develop a relational database system to support their digital transformation.

An old schema is already available, originally developed by a student project team some years ago. It already contains some relations and some attributes, which are needed for their business processes. Nonetheless, it is far from complete and cannot be used for its intended purpose.
