\section{Requirements from Stakeholders}

\subsection*{Head of Data (Miloš, EBU)}
\begin{quote}
“We want to understand how the voting changed over the years. Since 2016, the jury vote and televote are split. Before that, it was a single combined score. The model must reflect this split for newer years.”
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
“From 2023 on, both semi finals are solely decided on the televoting points.”
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Statistician (Anna, ESC Fan Club)}
\begin{quote}
“I want to find out which countries give each other the most points. And who gets lots of jury love but no public votes.”
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
“Every song belongs to a certain genre. I would like to see which genre is popular with the public and the jury respectively.”
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Archive Assistant (Luca)}
\begin{quote}
“We want to store the songs and artists too. Ideally with country, year, song title, artist name, points, and final rank.”
\end{quote}
